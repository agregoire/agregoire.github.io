<blockquote>
  This is the crux of what makes digital art conservation so hard. If the hardware components of a digital work of art are its flesh, the code is its soul. When the hardware can no longer be repaired or replaced, the essence of the artwork, the thing that gives it life--its binary code--has nothing to run on that can understand it and render it in a form that is comprehensible to humans. It is at that point in which digital art dies.<br/><br/>
