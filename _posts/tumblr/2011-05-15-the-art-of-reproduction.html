  <p>For a series of famous artworks, we&#8217;ve taken fragments from different reproductions found on the web, and (with a nod to David Hockney) assembled them back into wholes. In a few cases we&#8217;ve also created compositions made from the same detail across a set of different reproductions.</p>
