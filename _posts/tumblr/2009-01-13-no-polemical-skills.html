<blockquote>I know myself: I do not possess any polemical skill, my opponent distracts me, he interests me more as a man than as an opponent, I take pains to listen and run the risk of believing him; indignation and the correct judgment return later, on the way downstairs, when they are no longer of any use. It was best for me to stick to writing.</blockquote>&#8212;Primo Levi, The Periodic Table, Random House, New York, 1995, p. 218.
